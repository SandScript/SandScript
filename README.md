>  Yet another language with "Script" in the name

This repository contains SandScript, a statically typed interpreted language hosted by CSharp. The idea for this language began as a personal project to learn about the creation of languages and the technology and knowledge that goes into creating them.

##  Current State

This project is by no means production ready. It has many missing analysis steps, documentation is missing, and the API is not final.

## Requirements

[C# 10](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-csharp-10/)
[.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

## Features

* Strong static typing
* Fast and easy interop between CSharp and SandScript
* Easy to implement into projects
* Extendable

## Planned Features

* Standard library of procedures available to SandScript
*
